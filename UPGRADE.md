## Upgrade steps from v. 5.2.x to v. 5.3 for native/hybrid/react native apps

To upgrade native, hybrid and react native apps, we strongly recommend creating a new app from the app templates in [the forcedroid npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/forcedroid), then migrating the artifacts specific to your app into the new template.

See the [Mobile SDK Development Guide](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Shared/blob/master/doc/mobile_sdk.pdf?raw=true) for more information about developing hybrid apps with the Mobile SDK and Cordova.

If you have questions, or encounter any issues, we'd love to hear from you. Post any feedback you have on our [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/114225252149514546445).
